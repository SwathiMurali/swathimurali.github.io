## [Project 1: CUSTOMER COMPLAINT ANAYSIS AND PREDICTION SYSTEM](https://github.com/SwathiMurali/Customer-Complaint-Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT)

## Overview of the Project:
The project focuses on leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to process and derive meaningful insights from this dataset. The four primary tasks that were undertaken are:  
•	Complaint Classification: Classifying consumer complaints into relevant categories based on the type of issue reported, enabling companies to effectively address different customer concerns.  

•	Summarization: Automating the process of summarizing lengthy consumer narratives into concise, informative summaries. This allows businesses to quickly grasp the key points of customer feedback without sifting through extensive text.  

•	Sentiment Analysis: Evaluating the sentiment expressed in consumer narratives to understand the emotional tone behind customer complaints or feedback. This helps in determining customer satisfaction levels and identifying areas for improvement.  

•	Company Response Classification: Assessing the quality of company responses to consumer complaints, focusing on aspects like timeliness and relevance. This task is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of customer service practices and improving response strategies.
